Name of this project:
Data processing pipeline with web data

Type of project:
A client API is compiled as executive binary.

Brief description of the purpose:
We need face a large amount of online data every day, but it is not easy for some non-professional users from the perspective of programming. To address this problem, Iâ€™m ready to build a smart and user-friendly API so that we can process data within one line code.

Links to data sources / API:
https://openweathermap.org/

Outline the technical steps / challenges:
1. get online data by calling API
2.parse data if its type is JSON or XML
3. wrap the parsed data through Numpy or Pandas, then address the classification or regression task on these data.
4. perform some data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, for instance filling missing values, encode categorical features, normalization. I still need to complete the classification or regression task after applying some machine learning models.
5. Add docstrings und use Sphinx to generate package documentation
6. Make your package and associated material available online
7. Use Jupyter Notebook to generate a vignette on how to use your package functions
