    "I gone through the pyowm on GitHub. Generally, the pyowm is a client  Python wrapper around the OpenWeatherMap web API. My OpenWeatherAPI is like a customized python library to search historical weather data for specified location. Three major functions implemented by myself. ***get_search_weather*** uses loops to create an interactive API interface in order to access current weather data for any location. ***data_process*** is the main funtion to wrangle data and transform data into a dataset or Python object ready for analysis. ***get_coordination*** handle, parse, and transform JSON and XML content scraped from public websites, and I use regular expression to get the latitude and longitude of the input location."
